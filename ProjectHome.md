The basic idea behind Tmix is to generate realistic Internet traffic. In ns, we take _connection vectors_ and generate TCP connections starting at the specified time and sending the specified amount of data. Each connection has an _initiator_ (the node that starts the connection) and an _acceptor_ (the node that accepts the connection). These are generally on opposite sides of the network from each other.

Tmix has been included in the standard codebase of ns-2 since [ns-2.34](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/files/allinone/ns-allinone-2.34/) (June 2009).

Tmix for one-way TCP has been included since
[ns-2.35](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/files/allinone/ns-allinone-2.35/) (Nov 2011).
