# Tmix Internet Traffic Generator for the ns-2 Network Simulator #

The basic idea behind Tmix is to generate realistic Internet traffic. In ns, we take *connection vectors* and 
generate TCP connections starting at the specified time and sending the specified amount of data. Each connection has 
an *initiator* (the node that starts the connection) and an *acceptor* (the node that accepts the connection). These are 
generally on opposite sides of the network from each other. 

Tmix has been included in the standard codebase of ns-2 since 
[ns-2.34] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/files/allinone/ns-allinone-2.34/) (June 2009).

Tmix for one-way TCP has been included since 
[ns-2.35] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/files/allinone/ns-allinone-2.35/) (Nov 2011).
